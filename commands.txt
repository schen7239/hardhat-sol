npx solhint contracts/*.sol

module.exports.tags = ["all", "mocks"] found in ./deploy/00-deploy-mocks.js
this allows you to compile this file specifially if you include a tags
npx hardhat deploy --tags mocks


best practices:
pragma
imports
errorcodes: error ContractName__ErrorName
interface, libraries, contracts

contract syntax:
type declarations
state variables
event modifiers
functions

function order:
constructor
receive
fallback
external
public
internal
private
view/pure

import "hardhat/console.sol" so that you can use console.log within solidity files to debug

./artifacts/build-info/{any file} 
control f "opcodes"

even if variables are declared as private, they can still be read from the chain

revert > require because require is more expensive
